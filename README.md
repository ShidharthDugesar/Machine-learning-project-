Used Car Price Prediction
Project Overview 🚗
This project applies multiple regression models to predict the prices of used cars based on various features like mileage, year, brand, engine type, and more. By analyzing and preprocessing the dataset, I aimed to build an accurate model that could assist in evaluating used car prices effectively.

Objective 🎯
The main goal is to develop a model that can predict the price of a used car by analyzing key features. This model can help users understand the impact of various car attributes on their resale value.

Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about used cars, including:

Mileage
Year
Brand
Engine type
And other relevant features
The data required preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to prepare it for training.

Tech Stack & Methods 🛠️
Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, handling missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Plotted various graphs to understand the relationship between features like mileage, year, and price.
Models Used:
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Key Takeaways 📚
Feature Importance: Identified which car features influenced the prices the most.
Model Performance: Random Forest and Polynomial Regression models performed better than others in terms of accuracy and prediction.
Insights: The project provided valuable learning about the effectiveness of regression models in predicting continuous values and enhanced my skills in feature engineering.
Results 📈
The best-performing model was Random Forest, achieving an impressive R² score of 0.96, indicating strong predictive capability.
